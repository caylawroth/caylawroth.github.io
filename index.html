			<p> My name is Cayla Wroth and I am a senior at Ayala High School. I have been the Drum Major of the Ayala High School Marching Band for two years and am very 
			passionate about music. In addition to my musical passion, I have an interest in languages and have become fluent in Spanish and Tagalog, 
			and can read/write Korean. I also serve as the Vice President of the Ayala Polynesian Club and President of the AHS National Art Honor Society.
			Outside of school, I enjoy listening to K-Pop and spending time with my cats. </p>
			
		  <p> some interesting facts about me:
			<br>- I hope to attend UCLA in the fall of 2017.
			<br>- I am part of an organization called Watch the Wild where I serve as a Turtle Ambassador and collect information about the animals 
			<br> in the community.
			- I have been stung by a stingray. </p>
