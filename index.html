	<center><p> My name is Cayla Wroth and I am a senior at Ayala High School. I have been the Drum Major of the Ayala High School Marching Band for two years and am very passionate about music. In addition to my musical passion, I have an interest in languages and have become fluent in Spanish and Tagalog, and can read/write Korean. I also serve as the Vice President of the Ayala Polynesian Club and President of the AHS National Art Honor Society. Outside of school, I enjoy listening to K-Pop and spending time with my cats. <p></center>
